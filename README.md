# Monto-Carlo-Ray-Tracer

Implementation of a Monte Carlo ray tracer for the course TNCG15 - Global Illumination and Rendering at Link√∂ping University. The result is a rendered scene with objects of different materials and shapes, with features like color bleeding, soft shadows, reflections, and refractions. The materials are perfect reflectors, transparent, and diffuse (Lambertian and Oren Nayar).
