 * - It contains two instances of Vertex(the eye points) and a variable that allows you to switch between both eye points.
 * - It contains a 2D array of size 800Ã—800. Each element is a Pixel.
 * - Its method render() launches a ray through each pixel one at a time.
 * - The ray is followed through the scene and the radiance we give to the pixel is computed according to what we learnt in lectures 4 and 5.
 * - Initially and to test your code you follow the ray until it hits the first triangle and assign the triangle color to the ray.
 * - Camera also contains a method createImage():
